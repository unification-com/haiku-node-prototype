Haiku Node Prototype
====================

Welcome to Unification's Haiku Node Prototype. This is a working 
demo environment, meant to serve as a proof of concept implementation 
of the Unification specification, and to supplement
our [Whitepaper](https://d33ocdbzz0uvc8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/14131953/UnificationWhitepaper1.2.pdf).

EOS Smart Contracts written in C++, and the Haiku 
Node written in Python, are in this repository.

_This prototype implementation is being developed to refine the 
specification for the production implementation._

For detailed instructions on how to download, configure and run
the Haiku Node Prototype, please refer to the 
[Haiku Node Wiki](https://github.com/unification-com/haiku-node-prototype/wiki)

Haiku Node Prototype
====================

Welcome to Unification's Haiku Node Prototype. This is a working 
demo environment, meant to serve as a proof of concept, and to supplement
our Whitepaper.

**This is only a PROTOTYPE/Proof of Concept, and is not the final, 
production code. The prototype has been written in Python to enable 
rapid development and testing of new features and concepts.**

_For detailed instructions on how to download, configure and run
the Haiku Node Prototype, please refer to the
